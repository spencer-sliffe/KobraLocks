KobraLocks System Architecture Overview
│
├── Frontend/
│   ├── Web (ReactJS)
│   │   └── Communicates with Backend APIs for data
│   │
│   └── Mobile (React Native)
│       └── Communicates with Backend APIs for data
│
├── Backend/
│   ├── API Gateway
│   │   └── Routes requests to appropriate backend services, providing a single entry point for the frontend
│   │
│   ├── User Service (Django)
│   │   ├── Handles user authentication, preferences, and profile management
│   │   ├── Interacts with PostgreSQL for user data
│   │   └── Communicates with Frontend for user-related operations
│   │
│   ├── Betting Service (Django/Flask)
│   │   ├── Manages bets, betting pools, and strategies
│   │   ├── Interacts with PostgreSQL for structured betting data
│   │   └── Uses Machine Learning models for predictive analytics, feeding insights back to the frontend
│   │
│   └── Event Service (Django/Flask)
│       ├── Handles sports events, teams, and player data
│       ├── Interacts with both PostgreSQL for structured event data and MongoDB for real-time and historical event data
│       └── Communicates with external APIs (e.g., Sportradar, Odds API) to fetch real-time data and updates
│   
├── Machine Learning/
│   ├── Trains predictive models based on historical data stored in MongoDB
│   ├── Provides betting insights and predictions to the Betting Service
│   └── Continuously updated with new data for model improvement
│
├── Database/
│   ├── PostgreSQL
│   │   ├── Stores structured data: user profiles, betting records, events, and transactions
│   │   └── Interacts with Backend services for data retrieval and updates
│   │
│   └── MongoDB
│       ├── Stores semi-structured or unstructured data: user activities, real-time event data, betting insights
│       └── Interacts with Backend services, especially for real-time data processing and analytics
│
├── Third-party APIs/
│   └── Sportradar, Odds API, etc.
│       └── Provide real-time sports data, event information, and betting odds
│   
└── Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/Azure)
    ├── Hosts all components of the system for scalability and reliability
    ├── Manages load balancing, auto-scaling, and security
    └── Provides services for data storage, computation, and machine learning model deployment
