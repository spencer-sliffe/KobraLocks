- A high-level overview of how various Azure components will be structured for the KobraLocks project. 
- Includes the primary services that will likely be use to build a robust, scalable, and secure platform. 
- The structure allows for further expansion as new requirements or services arise throughout the lifecycle of the project. 

**In the future, each component needs to be reviewed & expanded thoroughly based on the specific operational, security, and compliance needs**
