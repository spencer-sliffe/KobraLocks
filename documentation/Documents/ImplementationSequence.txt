Project Setup and Planning:
	Define project requirements, objectives, and scope.
	Set up version control (Git) and repository structure.
	Create initial documentation (README.md).

Cloud Infrastructure Setup:
	Configure cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) for hosting all components.
	Set up services for data storage, computation, and networking.
	Implement security measures, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

Database Design and Implementation:
	PostgreSQL:
		Design and create schemas for structured data like user profiles, betting records, events, and transactions.
	MongoDB:
		Design and create collections for semi-structured or unstructured data like user activities, real-time event data, and betting insights.

Backend Services:
	API Gateway:
		Set up the API Gateway to route requests to appropriate backend services.
	User Service (Django/Flask):
		Implement user authentication, preferences, and profile management.
		Ensure communication with PostgreSQL for user data.
	Betting Service (Django/Flask):
		Manage bets, betting pools, and strategies.
		Interact with PostgreSQL and use ML models for predictive analytics.
	Event Service (Django/Flask):
		Handle sports events, teams, and player data.
		Interact with both PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and communicate with external APIs for real-time data.

Machine Learning Models:
	Develop and train predictive models using historical data stored in MongoDB.
	Set up a process for continuous data updating and model improvement.
	Integrate models with the Betting Service for insights and predictions.

Frontend Development:
	Web (ReactJS):
		Develop the structure and UI for the web application.
		Implement communication with backend APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.
	Mobile (React Native):
		Develop the structure and UI for the mobile application.
		Ensure mobile app communicates with backend APIs similarly.

Third-party APIs Integration:
	Integrate Sportradar, Odds API, etc., to fetch real-time sports data, event information, and betting odds.

Testing and Quality Assurance:
	Conduct thorough testing for each component (unit tests, integration tests).
	Perform end-to-end testing of the system to ensure all parts work together seamlessly.

Deployment:
	Deploy the backend services, databases, and frontend applications to the cloud infrastructure.
	Implement CI/CD pipelines for automatic testing and deployment.

Documentation and Final Review:
	Update documentation with final setup instructions, API endpoints, and usage guides.
	Conduct a final project review to ensure all requirements are met and the system functions as expected.

Launch and Monitoring:
	Officially launch the project.
	Set up monitoring and logging to track the system's performance and identify areas for improvement.
