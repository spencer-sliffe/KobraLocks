	Back-End: Python with frameworks like Django or Flask.
	Database: SQL for structured data storage; NoSQL (like MongoDB) for unstructured data.
	APIs: Real-time sports statistics we can use Sportradar, Odds API, etc...
3. Machine Learning and Data Processing
	Data Collection: Real-time and historical sports data using our APIs forementioned.
	Machine Learning: Python libraries scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch can be used for predictive modeling.
	Algorithm Development: Develop algorithms for betting odds calculation, parlay suggestions, and profitability analysis probably using machine learning as well.
4. AI Integration
	!!!!Automated Bet Slip Generation: Based on user preferences and predictive models.!!!
	Predictive Analytics: AI will help with forecasting game outcomes, player performance, etc.
	User Behavior Analysis: Learn from users to personalize their suggestions and improve their engagement.
5. Security and User Account Management
	Authentication: Use OAuth for secure login.
	Data Encryption: This protects our users' data and transaction details.
	User Profile Management: Allow users to manage their accounts, betting history, preferences, etc.
6. Testing and Deployment
	Unit Testing: For individual components like web, android, iOS.
	Integration Testing: Need to make sure everything works together seamlessly before releasing.
	Deployment: Cloud platforms like AWS or Azure for scalability and reliability.
				I would like to use Azure because I know it is good.
7. Continuous Improvement and Support

	Community Building: Bet with and against other friends. Share winnings/take losings
10. Technical Stack 
	Front-End: React Native (for cross-platform mobile development), ReactJS (Web).
	Back-End: Python (Django/Flask).
	Database: PostgreSQL (SQL), MongoDB (NoSQL).
	Machine Learning: TensorFlow, scikit-learn.
	APIs: Sportradar, Odds API, or other sports data providers.
